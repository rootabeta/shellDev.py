Just a simple utility to convert things like kernel32 or MessageBoxA into their modHash. 
I wanted to get this running in the python script as a utility, but couldn't get it working - and it isn't used at runtime anyway - so it's here.
Contains a linux x64 binary, and a makefile to make it on your current flavor. 
Usage:
./converter kernel32.dll
